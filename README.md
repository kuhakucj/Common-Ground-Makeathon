# Common Ground — Portal

Wireframe for the **Common Ground** makeathon portal. Two pages, no build step, no backend.

| Page | Who it is for | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`index.html`](index.html) | Builders | Explains the event, takes the email someone signed up with, and shows their Common Ground token plus the Codex / Figma / Mobbin codes attached to it. |
| [`admin.html`](admin.html) | Organisers | Edits everything on the front portal — copy, schedule, FAQ, tool credits and the participant roster. |

## Run it

No install, no bundler. Serve the folder:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 5180 --directory Portal
```

Then open <http://localhost:5180/index.html>. Opening the files directly with `file://` mostly works too, but a
local server is closer to production and keeps the clipboard API happy.

### Try the builder flow

The seeded roster covers each state worth designing for:

| Email | State you get |
| --- | --- |
| `ada@example.com` | Confirmed, one credit already redeemed |
| `jun@example.com` | Confirmed, nothing redeemed yet |
| `mentor@example.com` | Mentor ticket, everything redeemed |
| `waitlist@example.com` | Waitlist — no token, no codes |
| anything else | Not-found error state |

You can also deep-link straight to a token: `index.html?email=ada@example.com`.

## How the two portals connect

Both pages read and write one record through [`assets/data.js`](assets/data.js), kept in `localStorage`
under the key `cg-portal-v1`. Edit something in the organiser console, press **Save changes**, and the
builder portal shows it — reload it, or watch it update live if you have both open in separate tabs.

```
assets/data.js      one record: { event, perks, participants }  ← swap this for API calls
assets/portal.css   shared styling for both pages
assets/portal.js    builder portal: renders content, looks up a token by email
assets/admin.js     organiser console: edits the record
```

### The data shape

```jsonc
{
  "event": {
    "name": "Common Ground", "edition": "...", "tagline": "...",
    "dates": "...", "venue": "...", "capacity": "...", "heroNote": "...",
    "intro":    [{ "title": "", "body": "" }],
    "schedule": [{ "time": "", "title": "", "detail": "" }],
    "faq":      [{ "q": "", "a": "" }]
  },
  "perks": [{
    "id": "codex",              // links this credit to the per-person code below
    "name": "Codex", "kind": "AI PAIR PROGRAMMER",
    "value": "3 months Pro", "window": "REDEEM BEFORE 12 MAR",
    "blurb": "...", "redeemUrl": "https://...",
    "steps": ["Open the redeem link", "..."]
  }],
  "participants": [{
    "email": "ada@example.com",   // the lookup key — must be unique
    "name": "Ada Okonkwo", "team": "Team Driftwood", "ticket": "BUILDER",
    "status": "confirmed",        // confirmed | waitlist | cancelled
    "token": "CG-7K4M-QX21",      // the Common Ground token shown big on the page
    "codes":   { "codex": "CDX-8841-RRTP", "figma": "...", "mobbin": "..." },
    "claimed": { "codex": true,  "figma": false, "mobbin": false }
  }]
}
```

Only `status: "confirmed"` participants see credit cards. Everyone else gets a "nothing to redeem yet" state.

The **Import / export** panel downloads this whole record as JSON — hand that file to whoever wires up
the real backend, it is the schema.

## Turning this into the real thing

This is deliberately a wireframe. To make it production-ready:

1. **Replace the storage layer.** `CGData.load()` / `CGData.save()` in `assets/data.js` are the only two
   functions that touch `localStorage`. Point them at `GET /api/portal` and `PUT /api/portal` and nothing
   else in the codebase needs to change.
2. **Put a real check in front of the token.** Right now typing an email is enough. Email a magic link and
   render the token page only for a valid one — otherwise anyone can enumerate the roster.
3. **Put auth in front of `admin.html`.** It has no login at all, by design, so the wireframe is easy to click
   through. It must not ship as-is.
4. **Issue codes server-side.** The **Generate token + codes** button makes plausible-looking strings with
   `crypto.getRandomValues`. Real codes come from Codex / Figma / Mobbin and should be assigned to one
   person, once, and marked redeemed when used.
5. **Log redemptions.** The `claimed` flags are set by hand here. Track the real redeem-link click instead.

## Known wireframe limits

- Data lives in one browser. Another device, or a cleared cache, starts back at the sample roster.
- The redeem URLs point at `example.com`.
- No email sending, no magic links, no audit trail, no rate limiting on lookups.
- Sorting and pagination on the participants table are not built — search and status filter are.

## Design notes

Type is **Google Sans** for everything except labels and codes, which use IBM Plex Mono. Ground is
cream `#f5f5ef`, ink `#10120e`, with acid `#e9ff57` and hot pink `#fa1f93` — matching the Form / Signal
visuals so the two sit together.

Google Sans serves weights 400 / 500 / 700 (plus italic) from Google Fonts — there is no 600, so the
CSS uses 700 wherever a heavy weight is wanted. Fonts load via `<link>` with `preconnect` in each page
head rather than a CSS `@import`, so they do not block the first render.
Dark panels mark the parts that belong to *you* (your token, your codes); everything on cream is public
event information.
